# Transcriptomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in Type 2 Diabetes Using RNA-Seq

This project focuses on identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients and healthy controls using RNA-Seq data.

## Overview
RNA-Seq data from public repositories were processed through a standard bioinformatics pipeline including quality control, trimming, alignment, gene quantification, and differential expression analysis.

## Dataset
- Source: NCBI SRA (public dataset)
- Samples: 8 total
  - 4 Control
  - 4 T2D

Raw and intermediate sequencing files were not uploaded due to size constraints.

## Tools and Methods
- FastQC, MultiQC
- Trimmomatic
- HISAT2
- SAMtools
- featureCounts
- DESeq2 (R)

## Repository Status
This repository is under active development. Scripts, results, and documentation will be updated to ensure full reproducibility of the analysis.
