# Transcriptomic-Analysis-T2D-RNAseq
RNA-seq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in Type 2 Diabetes


This repository contains scripts and workflows for an RNA-seq based differential gene expression analysis comparing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) samples with healthy controls.

The repository is under active development. Scripts, results, and documentation will be updated progressively to ensure full reproducibility of the analysis.
